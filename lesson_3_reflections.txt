When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working from different computers, or basically every time, to avoid possibilities of data loss due to hardware malfunctions etc.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because when you are working with other people you dont want them to pass codes into the piece youre working with.
